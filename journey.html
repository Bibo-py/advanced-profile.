    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I’m Bahaa, a passionate computer science student and aspiring full-stack web developer. I love turning ideas into real projects, learning new technologies, and constantly improving my coding skills. Over the past few years, I’ve explored programming languages like Python and C, built websites, and completed full-stack development courses to strengthen my knowledge. My journey is all about growth, creativity, and pushing my limits to become a skilled developer ready to take on exciting challenges.

    <h2>My Journey:</h2>
    <p>
        I chose computer science because I’ve always been fascinated by how technology works and how software can solve real-world problems. I enjoy logical thinking and problem-solving, and programming allows me to create things from scratch—whether it’s an app, a website, or a complex system. Web development, in particular, caught my attention because it combines creativity with technical skills, letting me build interactive and visually appealing websites that people can use and enjoy. It’s exciting to see my ideas come to life online, and it motivates me to keep learning, experimenting, and improving my skills every day.
